        1. Start with a warm, personalized greeting
        2. Acknowledge their specific issue with genuine empathy
        3. Explain why escalation is beneficial (without making it sound negative)
        4. Clearly state that a human specialist will handle their case
        5. Set realistic expectations for response time (within 24 hours)
        6. Express appreciation for their patience
        7. Include the ticket ID for reference
        8. End with reassurance that their issue is important
